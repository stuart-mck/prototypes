<p>Ford have voluntarily recalled 233,791 Falcon model vehicles due to the possible failure of the steering rack mounting studs. </p>
<p>Affected vehicles were built between June 1, 1998 and May 22, 2001.</p>
<p>Vehicle models affected include AUI and AUII Falcon Forte, Futura, XR, Fairmont, Fairlane, LTD, FTE and Ute models built during this period, including 219,429 vehicles in Australia, 13,362 vehicles exported to New Zealand, and 1,000 vehicles exported to South Africa.</p>
<p>The recall is voluntary and a safety precaution due to the importance of steering components on any vehicle. Ford’s warranty department had recorded 28 claims in relation to this particular problem and there have been no reports of accidents or injuries caused by it.</p>
<p>Ford believe that the aluminium cross member that the studs are fixed into may crack due to over tightening of the steering rack mounting nuts.</p>
<p>Ford have clarified that the studs are not removable and the entire cross member and studs unit should be replaced if there is damage to either.</p>
<p>Since April 2000 Ford have marked the cross member with labels stating “STUDS NOT REMOVABLE” and “RACK NUT TORQUE 80Nm”.</p>
<p>All technicians working on these model Ford vehicles should be aware that the studs are not removable and over tightening them may cause cracking and failure of the cross member. </p>
